 Abstract:
 Emotions are an important part of human communication and can have a significant impact on our daily lives. This paper presents a robust deep learning model for predicting emotions in spoken language. The model was trained on a custom dataset created by combining five well-known datasets (CREMA-D, SAVEE, TESS, RAVDESS, and EmoDB). The dataset contains speech samples from a wide range of people representing a wide range of emotions. The model accurately predicts nine different emotions like happy, angry, fearful, sad, disgusted, calm, surprised, neutral and bored. The final experimental model with augmented data outperforms the other two experimental models I showed here and it gives 96.61% accuracy. When I compare the model to other cutting-edge approaches, I find that it performs similarly or better in terms of accuracy and outperforms category prediction. This model can greatly improve the human-computer interaction experience due to its ability to recognise a broader range of emotions. It has the potential to significantly impact a vast range of real-world applications and improve the way we communicate and interact with one another.
